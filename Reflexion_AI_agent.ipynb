            "    answer: To handle the climate crisis, we must adopt a multi-faceted approach that involves both individual and collective actions. Firstly, governments and corporations must prioritize sustainable practices, such as investing in renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, individuals can make a significant impact by making conscious choices in their daily lives, such as reducing meat consumption, using public transport, and conserving water. Furthermore, it is essential to support climate change research and development of new technologies that can help mitigate the effects of climate change. We must also work together to protect and restore natural ecosystems, such as forests and oceans, which play a crucial role in regulating the climate. Lastly, it is vital to address the social and economic inequalities that are exacerbated by climate change, by providing support and resources to vulnerable communities and promoting climate justice.\n",

Climate change mitigation actions include conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.[1][2] Current climate change mitigation policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about 2.7 °C by 2100,[3] [...] powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes.[citation needed] Certain processes are more difficult to decarbonise, such as air travel and cement production. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be an option to reduce net emissions in these circumstances, although fossil fuel power plants with CCS technology is currently a high cost climate change mitigation strategy.[9] [...] Proforestation is promoting forests to capture their full ecological potential.[130] This is a mitigation strategy as secondary forests that have regrown in abandoned farmland are found to have less biodiversity than the original old-growth forests. Original forests store 60% more carbon than these new forests.[131] Strategies include rewilding and establishing wildlife corridors.[132][133]\\nAfforestation and reforestation[edit]\", \"score\": 0.9307171}, {\"title\": \"Climate change mitigation: reducing emissions\", \"url\": \"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-mitigation-reducing-emissions\", \"content\": \"EU Member States have put in place 3,000 policies and measures to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. National climate change mitigation strategies, policies and other accompanying measures are also in development. These include targets for greenhouse gas emissions in key sectors of the economy, promoting the use of renewable energy and low carbon fuels, energy efficiency improvements in buildings, and many more. [...] Mitigating climate change means reducing the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This involves cutting greenhouse gases from main sources such as power plants, factories, cars, and farms. Forests, oceans, and soil also absorb and store these gases, and are an important part of the solution.

            "    answer: To handle the climate crisis, we must adopt a multi-faceted approach that involves both individual and collective actions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), transitioning to renewable energy sources and enhancing carbon sinks are crucial steps in mitigating climate change [1]. Additionally, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from main sources such as power plants, factories, cars, and farms is essential. As noted by the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar PV is currently the only renewable energy technology on track with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario [2]. Furthermore, global climate governance plays a critical role in addressing the climate crisis, with bilateral cooperation and informal agreements between national and subnational actors being essential for effective climate policy responses [3].\n",
